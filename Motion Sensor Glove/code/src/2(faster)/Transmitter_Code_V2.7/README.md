**Module 2**
====================================
This code contains only transmitter code, which means we connect the transmitter(Arduino Mega2560) to laptop directly.
-----------------

    Make sure you have moved the *SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library folder* and the *RadioHead* into a libraries folder within your Arduino sketchbook or use the Library Manger to install.

- *Transmitter_Code_V2.7* should be uploaded to the Arduino Uno. Baud rate is **2000 00**.
